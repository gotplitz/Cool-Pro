                                        About a month ago Eric and the office and field crews installed a new Rheem heating and cooling system.
The weather has not allowed me to experience the A/C, however, the heating system with its humidifier, U/V light, and filter systems are all working to create a very noticeable improvement to the air quality in my house.

                                            Fantastic experience, could not have
                                            picked a better company to deal
                                            with. Interviewed several other
                                            contractors and none of them fully
                                            understood what was actually
                                            required to perform my job properly.
                                            Only regret is that I didn't have
                                            them perform this work years
                                            earlier.

                                            We highly recommend Cool Pro. We had
                                            a new HVAC system installed in our
                                            home 3 years ago. Everything has
                                            been running with no issues. From
                                            the estimate to scheduling to
                                            install everything went smoothly &
                                            as promised! Eric and his team are
                                            professional & answer all questions
                                            honestly. So refreshing to work with
                                            a qualified company.

                                            call to the office and the estimate
                                            by Eric to the installation of the
                                            new system was professional and
                                            courteous. Options were explored and
                                            explained in advance and questions
                                            were answered promptly and
                                            completely. The job cost exactly
                                            what was quoted, they arrived on
                                            time and left the premises clean.
                                            The office followed up a few hours
                                            after the team left to confirm we
                                            were satisfied. Couldn't ask for
                                            better customer service. Our unit
                                            was installed nearly 2 years ago and
                                            we are still very happy with the
                                            decision we made. Shortly after our
                                            unit was installed, on our
                                            recommendation, two of our friends
                                            used Cool Pro Mechanical and both
                                            were very happy with their
                                            experiences as well. Very highly
                                            recommend. All contractors should be
                                            modeled on this company's
                                            performance.

                                            Cool Pro warrants my time and
                                            effort. Not only are they incredibly
                                            polite, considerate, and easy to
                                            deal with, they are hyper competent.
                                            They are easy to work with with
                                            regard to booking appointments,
                                            respectful of your time, your house
                                            and your family. They are honest and
                                            upfront and try to work with the
                                            system you have instead of
                                            up-selling. Eric really knows his
                                            stuff and easy easy to talk to and a
                                            good listener. Can't recommend this
                                            company highly enough.

                                            I had my air conditioning unit
                                            installed last year by Cool Pro.. It
                                            is one of the best investments I
                                            ever made to my house in 47 years. I
                                            honestly don't know why I waited so
                                            long. I think I was afraid to cause
                                            problems in my house and also the
                                            expense. Being on a fixed income it
                                            was a lot to consider doing this
                                            home improvement. My friend
                                            recommended Eric from Cool Pro to
                                            come to my home and give me an
                                            estimate which I did after two
                                            unbearable summers of extreme heat.
                                            I must say Eric impressed my very
                                            much and he spoke to me like I
                                            wasn't the old worman I really am.
                                            He had patients and time to let me
                                            know the cost, how the unit works
                                            and how and when this could be done
                                            in my home. MY children don't know
                                            why I waited so long and quite

                                            minute of the long hot summer we
                                            had. I had NO problems and the units
                                            were quiet and efficient. Thank you

                                            Good Company. Margaret in the office
                                            and Brian my tech were both
                                            excellent and honest. I will use

                                            Very professional and fare. They
                                            provided us an honest price. But
                                            most importantly they had guided us
                                            to take advantage of power company
                                            rebates to end-up with a 20 Seer

                                            Being our home is over 100 years
                                            old, it was a very difficult
                                            situation to retrofit central air.
                                            Eric and Rene developed and
                                            installed an excellent solution. Our

                                            comfortable with no negative impact
                                            to its aesthetics. Everyone,from

                                            I want to thank Eric, the
                                            installation team and the office
                                            staff over at Cool Pro Mechanical.
                                            They did an amazing job from start
                                            to finish. Eric was very
                                            knowledgeable and was very helpful
                                            in finding the right AC/Heating
                                            system for our home. Eric answered
                                            all our questions and concerns and
                                            the office staff was very prompt in
                                            getting quotes and installation set
                                            up. The work was done
                                            professionally, on time and exactly
                                            when discussed. The value for the
                                            unit, installation and customer
                                            service is exceptional. I would
                                            highly recommend this company.
